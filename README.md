Inversion of Control and Dependency Injection
weak coupling must be used (Interfaces).
Dependency injection must be done using dynamic instantiation
The Open-Closed Principle (OCP) states that software entities (classes, modules, methods, etc.) 
should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
In practice, this means creating software entities whose behavior can be changed without the need to edit and recompile the code itself.
